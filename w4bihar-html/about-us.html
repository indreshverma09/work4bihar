              <h3>Bihar needs a Reform and we the people are the reformers!</h3>
              <p>Work For Bihar is an empowerment initiative to replenish the state of Bihar with innovation, development, gender equality, and human rights, with a huge emphasis on agriculture, employment, education and healthcare. Our aim lies in equipping able hands with the right resources so those who were previously at the mercy of Metropolitans and urban places can find a proper occupation in their own land. We want to foster development, agriculture and healthcare in Bihar so that people witness it become a prominent state when it comes to innovation and self-sustainability. We are determined to empower students, women and skilled labour so that Bihar can finally recover from the long bleak state in which it seems to be trapped since ages.</p>
              <p>Bihar has been isolated from the modern culture, development and proper governance for a long period. It is the time to become the voice of hundreds of thousands of Biharis who are either living in poverty, are illiterate or are deprived of their rights and services while also taking the rife corruption into account and reducing its footprint from across the state. Work for Bihar aims to eliminate one of the central challenges that repress biharâ€™s growth, let us unite and address them with affection and enthusisam.</p>

              <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
              <p>India, the second most populated region in the world is also a third world country which accounts for a population well above a billion people. Out of the entire population, women represent 48.4% with males being dominant by 51.6% (Census 2011). Though India is a developing country, it is etched with uncountable instances of women oppression, rape, slavery and misogyny. Bihar is no different. </p>
              <p>Women have long been the victims of oppression and inequality in Bihar. In our mission for women empowerment, we will track every nook and cranny of the state of Bihar to narrow down on women who are oppressed or living in poor conditions. We intend to achieve this by small rallies and motivational approach through the unfettered support of our volunteers and workforce on the ground.</p>

              <p>As our core values revolve around equality and women rights, we aim to educate and empower women for significant positive development outcomes. Work for Bihar believes that giving women economic empowerment would not only benefit their households and communities but ultimately their countries. We pledge to equip their able hands with the right resources and enable them to set forth on a developing journey. Gaining access to education, support and ever-standing help would make them self-capable, earn a respectable status, and add value to the immediate ecosystem. They can also become financially independent while taking care of themselves & others around them, thus reducing hunger and poverty.</p>

              <p>
                Empowering more women to learn and work, result in better growth of the third world countries. We want to encourage women irrespective of age, caste and creed so that they can vocalize their concerns and express themselves proactively. Work For Bihar will give them a platform which will see an increase in women enrollment in schools and reduced child marriages. Our focus on child marriages and women-related crimes will remain intact and we are sure that it will open up avenues of a more productive ecosystem for Bihar where other similar states would soon follow.
              </p>
              <p>Our core concerns lie in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Granting women a special status where their rights are constantly violated.</li>
                <li>Providing them access to better healthcare services.</li>
                <li>Liberating them from abuse and slavery of patriarchy.</li>
                <li>Assisting women from all backgrounds to hone their skills.</li>
                <li>Providing the underprivileged with quality education.</li>
              </ul>
